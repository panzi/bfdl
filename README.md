Binary Format Description Language
==================================

In this project I'm coming up with a binary format description language, just
for fun. Haven't even googled if there is such a thing already before I
started this. I did now, there is a BFD and it uses XML. I'd rather stop being
a software developer than to use that.

The goal of this for fun project is to have a BFDL compiler that can generate
Python and C code for reading and writing binary files and for printing
information about files in a nice textual form.

**NOTE:** This is work in progress. I've only wrote a BFDL tokenizer so far.
And I haven't made my mind up about the license. Will probably be some sort of
open source license.
